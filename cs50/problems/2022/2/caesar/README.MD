Let’s write a program called caesar that enables you to encrypt messages using Caesar’s cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime. We shouldn’t necessarily assume that the user’s key is going to be a number; though you may assume that, if it is a number, it will be a positive integer.

Here are a few examples of how the program might work. For example, if the user inputs a key of 13 and a plaintext of HELLO:


 ./caesar 13
 
 
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq
